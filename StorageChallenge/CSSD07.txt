In this challenge you will use the following files:
- Models/CosmosDBSQLContext.cs: You will add code to this file to interact with a private blob storage container.
- web.config: You will set the testType app setting to 16 in this file.

You will reference the following objects in your code:
- CSSTDModels.ICosmosDBSQLContext: You will implement this interface for the CosmosDBSQLContext class.
   You will implement the following members:

		//Create a database and document collection.  This uses async methods.
        Task CreateCollection();

		//Retrieve all documents
        List<ProductDocument> GetDocuments();

		//Retrieve a filtered list of documents
        List<ProductDocument> GetDocuments( string industry);

		//Upload a list of documents
        Task UploadDocuments( List<ProductDocument> documents);


- CSSTDModels.ProductDocument: This class is used by the evaluation engine.  ProductDocument objects will be passed into and out of methods you implement by this class.
    public class ProductDocument
    {
        [Description("Arbitrary key - set to a GUID")]
        public string ID { get; set; }

        [Description("Industry designation, currently 'Training' or 'Swimming'")]
        public string Industry { get; set; }

        [Description("Name of the product")]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [Description("Pricing tier, currently 'Basic' or 'Premium'")]
        public string Tier { get; set; }

        [Description("Product description, primarily in Latin with a little English embedded for searching.")]
        public string Description { get; set; }

    }
