In this challenge you will use the following files:
- Models/SQLServerContext.cs: You will add code to this file to interact with an Azure SQL Server database.
- web.config: You will set the testType app setting to 4 in this file.

You will reference the following objects in your code:
- CSSTDModels.ISQLServerContext: You will implement this interface for the SQLServerContext class.
	ISQLServerContext has the following members:
		//Connection string for database
        string ConnectionString { get; set; } 

		//Method to create the Customers table
        void CreateTable() 

		//Method to retrieve customer data
        List<CustomerData> GetData() 

		//Method to load a list of customers into the Customers table
        void LoadData(List<CustomerData> customers) 

- CSSTDModels.CustomerData: This class is used by the evaluation engine.  CustomerData objects will be passed into and out of methods you implement by this class.
	CustomerData has the following members:
	    [Description("Arbitrary primary key")]
        public int ID { get; set; }
