In this challenge you will use the following files:
- Models/MySQLContext.cs: You will add code to this file to interact with a private blob storage container.
- web.config: You will set the testType app setting to 8 in this file.

You will reference the following objects in your code:
- CSSTDModels.IMySQLContext: You will implement this interface for the MySQLContext class.
	IMySQLContext has the following members:

		//The ConnectionString holds the, well, connection string
	    string ConnectionString { get; set; }

		//Create the vendors table
        void CreateTable();

		//Load sample data into the vendor table
        void LoadData(List<VendorData> vendors);

		//Retrieve a list of vendors
        List<VendorData> GetData();

- CSSTDModels.VendorData: This class is used by the evaluation engine.  VendorData objects will be passed into and out of methods you implement by this class.
